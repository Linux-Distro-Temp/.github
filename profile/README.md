## üêß Overview

This is a free and open-source Linux distribution that blends the philosophies and strengths of NixOS and Artix Linux. It is designed for users who value transparency, control, and reproducibility‚Äîoffering a systemd-free experience with a fully declarative approach to configuration and package management.

At the core of this distribution is a strictly declarative package manager, inspired by Nix flakes, but with a more opinionated and streamlined design. Rather than supporting imperative package installation or multiple configuration styles, this system embraces one clear way to manage packages: declaratively through TOML files. This choice prioritizes simplicity, consistency, and reproducibility.

Unlike traditional distros that host their own package repositories‚Äîwhich can become a maintenance burden over time‚Äîthis system adopts a "captain of your own ship" philosophy. Users are empowered and expected to define and manage their own "flake" sources and configurations. This avoids the complexity and sustainability challenges of centralized package hosting.

Security is a key priority. The distribution comes with ClamAV (antivirus) and Suricata (intrusion detection/prevention system) preconfigured with sensible defaults, helping users deploy secure systems out of the box.

## üöß Project Status

This project is currently in the design and planning phase. Development will begin after core architectural decisions are finalized and the trademark process is complete.

In the meantime, we're focusing on:
- Finalizing the distribution's goals and scope
- Designing the declarative TOML-based configuration system
- Laying the groundwork for package and security tooling
- Preparing for sustainable long-term development

Stay tuned, and feel free to watch or star the repository to follow updates as they come.

## üîç Description

This distribution takes inspiration from both:

- **[NixOS](https://nixos.org)** ‚Äì Known for its declarative configuration, atomic upgrades, and package management through the Nix language.
- **[Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org)** ‚Äì A systemd-free Arch-based distribution offering alternative init systems like OpenRC, runit, and s6.

The goal is to merge these ideas into a cohesive operating system that values transparency, reproducibility, and user control.
